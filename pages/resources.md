By selecting the forward kinematics as predictors and inverse kinematics as response, the team trained the data accordingly. The first step was to use to train the raw data and observe the results. The team utilized the first portion of the data to train with the data division of 70%, 15% and 15% as training set, validation set and test set. The training algorithm was Levenberg-Marquardt and the performance was determined by the mean squared error.
