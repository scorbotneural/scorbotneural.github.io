Raw Data
After generating the raw dataset of the forward and inverse kinematics, the dataset was trained using shallow neural network with the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm

Normalized Data 
Forward kinematics and inverse kinematics were both normalized and the normalized dataset was trained with the training algorithm Levenberg â€“ Marquardt.

Normalised PCA data 

Principle component analysis is a form of dimensionality reduction technique. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. PCA was performed on both forward kinematic and inverse kinematics. The dataset was trained with the training algorithm Levenberg Marquardt. The results for the trained dataset are as shown.
